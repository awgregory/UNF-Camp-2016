## Assignment

Modify the web application in the Demo Code folder to support *editing blog posts*. This will require:

1. An "Edit" link on the Detail page for a blog post, that links to an Edit page.
2. A GET Edit action method and view that renders a form with the title and body of the selected post, pre-populated with the existing post fields.
3. A POST Edit action method that modifies the selected blog entry with the new fields and redirects to the Detail page for that post.
